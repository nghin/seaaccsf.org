Explore the museum for free as a part of this annual program held during the Asian Heritage Street Celebration (http://asianfairsf.com/). We are also celebrating International Museum Day. This year’s theme, Museums for a Sustainable Society, recognizes the role of museums as important locations of cultural exchange and mutual understanding, enriching the lives of community members. In conjunction with the Asian Heritage Street Celebration and International Museum Day, the Tenderloin community's Southeast Asian Arts & Culture Coalition (SEAACC) presents music and dance from Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. The SEAACC is an organization dedicated to the diverse cultures of the Tenderloin neighborhood. Other activities include the Center for Asian American Media’s cinema showcase, docent tours and hands-on art making that will bring the museum's masterpieces to light.
