  text: 'SEAACC’s vision stems from the 3 P’s:<br /> 
  <strong>Preserve</strong> – Embrace and cultivate the historical impact that arts and culture has provided within the Southeast Asian community.<br />
  <strong>Promote</strong> – We believe that cultural advancement and ethnic identity comes from an awareness of how one’s roots play a significant role in community development.<br /> 
  <strong>Practice</strong> – Education and theory is useless without application. Different cultural and social activities are held in the San Francisco Bay Area so that anyone and everyone can be involved and engaged within the community.'

  title: "WHO WE ARE"
  url: '/english/who-we-are/'
  text: 'The Southeast Asian Arts & Culture Coalition of San Francisco was founded in 2011 by various ethnic interest groups across the San Francisco Bay Area. We saw a lack of cultural promotion and preservation in the Southeast Asian community, and knew that there had to be a change. The coalition was started to help address a need in the Tenderloin community for more cultural awareness.'
